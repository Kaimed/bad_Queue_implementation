This was an old class project where we had to make a very bastardized implementation of a Queue;
	Functions included:
		enqueue
		dequeue
		clear
		delete item from queue (IE bastardization)
	Also there is a function which essentially will divide the queue into two different queues, and gives you the ability to interact with both, inside of the same structure
	It was built for a mock "car" struct which is also included in Queue.h
